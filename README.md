# Fastag-Fraud-Detection-project

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based fraud detection system for Fastag transactions. Fastag is an electronic toll collection system in India that uses RFID technology to make toll payments directly from a prepaid account linked to a user's vehicle. As digital transactions become more prevalent, the risk of fraudulent activities also increases. This project leverages machine learning classification techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions, ensuring the security and integrity of Fastag transactions.
