## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based fraud detection system for Fastag transactions. Fastag is an electronic toll collection system in India that uses RFID technology to make toll payments directly from a prepaid account linked to a user's vehicle. As digital transactions become more prevalent, the risk of fraudulent activities also increases. This project leverages machine learning classification techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions, ensuring the security and integrity of Fastag transactions.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based Fastag fraud detection system capable of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities in electronic toll transactions. By leveraging ML algorithms, the model can continuously learn and adapt to emerging fraud patterns, improving its accuracy and effectiveness over time.

## Objectives

**1. Early Fraud Detection :** ML models analyze transaction patterns to identify anomalies and suspicious activities that may indicate fraudulent behavior.Timely detection enables proactive intervention, minimizing financial losses.

**2. Minimizing False Negatives :** Reducing false negatives is crucial to ensure that fraudulent transactions are not overlooked while minimizing inconvenience to legitimate users. he model is fine-tuned to differentiate between normal and suspicious transactions, improving its reliability.

**3. Enhancing Accuracy :** The model continuously learns from new data, adapting to evolving fraud techniques. Regular retraining helps maintain high detection accuracy and effectiveness against emerging threats.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the application of various machine learning models for fraud detection. Through experimentation, I gained a deeper understanding of model parameters, hyperparameter tuning, and their impact on overall performance.

From the analysis, Decision Trees emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an impressive 99.9% accuracy on the dataset. Since fraud detection prioritizes reducing false negatives, recall was a key metric in model evaluation. Across all ML models tested, recall values remained high, ensuring improved fraud identification and prevention.

This project not only demonstrated the power of machine learning in financial security but also enhanced my understanding of model optimization and evaluation techniques.
